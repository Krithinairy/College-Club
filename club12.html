            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>What is the club about: At Aura, our mission is to extend a helping 
                hand to the less privileged members of our community.
                Some of our primary objectives is to focus on critical social matters such as Suicide Prevention, 
                Mental Health, and Gender Equality. Through our sessions, we strive to raise awareness and 
                promote understanding of these important issues within our community. Additionally, we actively 
                contribute to environmental sustainability by organizing donation drives for items like Clothes, 
                Toys, and Hair, encouraging recycling and responsible resource utilization. We believe in the 
                power of empathy and connection by regularly visiting Special Schools, Old Age Homes, and 
                Orphanages to spread positivity and make meaningful contributions to the lives of others.</p>
